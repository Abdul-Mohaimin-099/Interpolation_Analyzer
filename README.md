# Interpolation Analyzer

## üìä Project Overview

The Interpolation Analyzer is a sophisticated web-based tool designed to visualize and analyze various numerical interpolation methods. This interactive platform bridges the gap between theoretical mathematics and practical application, making complex interpolation concepts accessible to students, educators, and professionals.

### üéØ Purpose

This tool serves multiple purposes:
- **Educational Tool**: Helps students understand different interpolation methods through visual representation
- **Analysis Platform**: Enables researchers to compare and evaluate various interpolation techniques
- **Data Processing**: Provides accurate interpolation results for real-world data sets
- **Visualization**: Offers interactive graphs for better understanding of interpolation behavior

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Data Processing
- **CSV File Support**: Upload and process data from CSV files
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant calculation and visualization of results
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and error checking for input data
- **Data Export**: Download interpolated results in CSV format

### Interpolation Methods
- **Linear Interpolation**: Simple and efficient linear point-to-point interpolation
- **Cubic Spline**: Smooth curve fitting with continuous first and second derivatives
- **Newton Forward**: Efficient for equally spaced data points
- **Newton Backward**: Better accuracy for later intervals in the data set
- **Divided Differences**: Handles unequally spaced data points effectively

### Visualization
- **Interactive Plots**: Dynamic, zoomable, and pannable graphs
- **Multi-method Comparison**: View multiple interpolation methods simultaneously
- **Error Analysis**: Real-time Mean Square Error (MSE) calculations
- **Color-coded Results**: Easy-to-distinguish different interpolation methods
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Learning Resources
- **Method Descriptions**: Detailed explanations of each interpolation technique
- **Use Cases**: Examples of real-world applications
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for choosing appropriate methods
- **Interactive Examples**: Pre-loaded examples for learning
